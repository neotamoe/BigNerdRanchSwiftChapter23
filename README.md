# BigNerdRanchSwiftChapter23

## Summary

Working my way through the Big Nerd Ranch Guide - Swift Programming as part of Prime Digital Academy's 30 day Github 
Challenge (make one commit a day).  This challenge took place during Tier 3 and most days I worked through one chapter/day.
My goal was to learn more about Swift 3 and XCode to expose myself to a language used in mobile development.
